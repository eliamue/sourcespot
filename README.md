## Accessibility in Tech

Resources to help TBI survivors reduce and manage symptoms that can make use of technology difficult

### Eye Health

Screen use is a necessity nowadays, whether in work or leisure. Without accommodation, symptoms such as migraine, eye pain & pressure, over-stimulation, and nausea can become quickly debilitating for TBI survivors. While most tech and software development doesn't take into consideration the inaccessibility that bright, white screens and backgrounds can cause to TBI survivors and even neurotypical users, tools exist that can help lessen the effects of screen use on the eyes and brain with apps/extensions that:

-Force dark mode onto sites that do not provide it<br>
-Filters your device's screen with customizable contrast, hue, and brightness<br>
-Prevent videos and gifs from auto-playing<br>
-Re-renders pages into a simple, readable format without the flashy styling and elements that can be too overwhelming and distracting<br>
